#   @NgModule

In angular, Everything is a class 

--we need atleast one module known as root module

--which have information about all the components which have been created inside array imports.

-- It also contains information of any third party librararies

--If we see in the browser, we have BrowserModule(it is a part of angular module)


#Any component, Directive and Pipes needs to be registerd by declarations: array inside @ngModule({
    declarations:[]
})


--* i can create n no. of modules. it need atleast one root module 


#AppModule is class which knows everything about application, all different modules i am using, different components. It gives information to the compiler.

@NgModule
-- whatever class we are compiling, what type of class is that.

--this is decorator (it modifies the behavior of the class)

-- it gives the metadata information wha t are hte modules we are using, components everything.

@NgModule(
{

#components

-- components are somthing which are views to render to the end user.

-- AppComponent is the first component (app.component.ts)

###in app.component.ts
-- We have @Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})

#selector

-- it includes basically HTML tag, but it needs to be render to the html:

#templateUrl

-- it points the particular html file path which i want to render. For inline we can use use template instead of templateUrl. for multi line we can use tilt operator `` then write the html

--eg: @Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template:'<h1> Hello World from inline template </h1>',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})

#styleUrls

--it points the particular css file path which i want to render.
