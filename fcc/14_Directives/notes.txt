##Types of Directives
1. Structural Directives

-- They are costier because they are going to change the behaviour of the DOM. Which may give you performance issues as well.

2.Attribute Directive

--We use this lot of the times


##Built in Directives

1. *ngIf
--entire div will display when the condition true, otherwise entire div will gone.

--the perfect usecase some secure information which we dont want to display to all user. We want to enable that area in some particular case.

--use as many i can in angular this feature. Dont rely on hidden Attribute

2. *ngFor

--it is very useful in such cases where we have array of objects and we just need to bind it.

--it gives access to few more things like even or odd values

--* whats this star means --> they are two types of directive. * differetiate the type of directive. * represent the structural directives. (structural directives can modify the DOM)

3. *ngSwitch

-- it is something, we use rarely but 


4. *ngClass

--this is related to style

5. *ngStyle

--this is related to style
